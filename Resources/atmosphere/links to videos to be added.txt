What did Earth look like at first?
The earliest Earth did not have an atmosphere or free water. The planet was far too hot for gases and water to collect. The atmosphere and oceans that we see today evolved over time. The gases came from volcanic eruptions and from comets.
Earthâ€™s first atmosphere was different from the current one. The gases came from two sources. Volcanoes spewed gases into the air. Comets carried in ices from outer space. These ices warmed and became gases. Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water vapor, or water in gas form, were in the first atmosphere (Figure below). Take a look at the list of gases. What's missing? The early atmosphere had almost no oxygen.
Eventually plants evolved. Plants produce oxygen as a product of photosynthesis. Oxygen spread around the planet about 2.5 billion years ago. Many organisms died off because they could not handle the oxygen. But this development was extremely important for other life. Animals need oxygen to breathe. If photosynthesis had not evolved there would be no animals.

Oxygen is needed to make ozone. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen ions. Ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks harmful solar radiation from reaching the surface. Without oxygen, life on Earth would have been very simple.
