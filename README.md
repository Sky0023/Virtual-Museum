## Project Description

Samsarah- A Virtual Museum Depicting the Marvelous History of Mother Earth
NASA missions have always provided deep insights into mankind. It is extremely important for all to know about such cool and interesting missions, especially young students! Our project is a very fun and intriguing virtual museum, which showcases the digital history of earth, from its inception to its present, in an extremely captivating way! Fascinating information about space missions, origin of the earth, and other facts, are presented to the audience in an engaging way through audio, visuals and games, suitable for both children and adults! This project is a Virtual Reality Application, developed using Unity.
How We Addressed This Challenge
Huge amount of captivating data is present on NASA and NASA's partner agencies which create a spark in young minds.

Our Virtual museum, 'Samsarah' introduces this library to young students.

The virtual museum lets them explore this spell-binding data in a fun and enthralling way!

How We Developed This Project
The main inspiration for our project was the fact that so many students with so much talent and interest in space science are not aware of the spellbinding data made available by NASA, and if they do, they find it difficult to navigate and understand that data.

Our virtual museum was completely developed on Unity. The team collaborated on GitHub.

The major challenge we faced was assembling and categorizing the resources so as to provide information in a crisp and interesting way so that the students were able to retain it.

How We Used Space Agency Data in This Project
NASA is the most reputed organization in astrophysics, and earth and space science. The inspiration for our project came from the fact that many students with interest in space science are not aware of the spellbinding data made available by NASA. The data made available by NASA through Sateliites likeAqua, CloudSat etc. is extremely fascinating, accurate and reliable. While searching for these resources, we too enjoyed learning about the earth as much as we enjoyed building the application. The motto of our project is to let young students understand the joy of learning and introduce/expose them to data made available by NASA and its partner agencies.
